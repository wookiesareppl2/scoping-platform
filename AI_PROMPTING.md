## Common Modification Patterns

### Adding New Questions

1. **Location**: `src/types/scoping.js`
2. **Pattern**: Add to the appropriate category's questions array
3. **Required fields**: `id`, `text`, `type`, `required`, `category`
4. **Optional fields**: `hint`, `placeholder`, `options`, `showIf`

Example:
```javascript
{
  id: 'new_question_id',
  text: 'What is your question?',
  type: 'text', // text, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, number
  required: true,
  category: SCOPING_CATEGORIES.BUSINESS,
  hint: 'This helps us understand...',
  placeholder: 'Enter your answer here...'
}
```

```
"Create a budget tier selection system that:
- Presents clear options for different budget levels (budget-constrained vs full-budget)
- Provides transparent communication about limitations and benefits for each tier
- Uses professional, consultative language that builds trust
- Includes comprehensive warnings and expectations for budget-constrained projects
- Maintains professional presentation while being honest about constraints

Focus on expectation management and client education rather than sales."
```

#### **Conditional Form Logic**
```
"Implement conditional form logic that:
- Shows different options based on previous selections (budget tier, project type, etc.)
- Adapts subsequent questions and validation rules appropriately
- Maintains form state and passes context between components
- Provides clear guidance and examples relevant to the selected path
- Ensures smooth user experience with logical flow progression

Include proper error handling and validation for conditional fields."
```

#### **Professional Limitation Communication**
```
"Design limitation communication that:
- Clearly explains constraints without being negative or discouraging
- Emphasizes the value and quality still provided within constraints
- Uses professional, consultative language that builds confidence
- Provides context for why limitations exist (business viability, quality maintenance)
- Offers alternatives or upgrade paths when appropriate

Focus on transparency and trust-building rather than restriction."
```

### **Component Architecture Patterns**

#### **Budget-Aware Component Design**
```jsx
// Professional budget tier selector with clear expectations
const BudgetTierSelector = ({ selectedTier, onTierSelect }) => {
  const budgetTiers = [
    {
      id: 'budget-constrained',
      title: 'Budget-Constrained Project',
      price: 'Starting from $500-$2,000',
      includes: [/* clear inclusions */],
      limitations: [/* honest limitations */],
      warnings: [/* professional considerations */]
    },
    {
      id: 'full-budget',
      title: 'Custom Development Project', 
      price: 'Starting from $3,000+',
      includes: [/* comprehensive features */],
      limitations: [], // No limitations for full budget
      warnings: []
    }
  ];

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Professional tier comparison */}
      {budgetTiers.map(tier => (
        <TierCard 
          key={tier.id}
          tier={tier}
          isSelected={selectedTier === tier.id}
          onSelect={() => onTierSelect(tier.id)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### **Conditional Requirements Component**
```jsx
// Dynamic options based on budget selection
const ConditionalRequirements = ({ budgetTier, selectedType, onTypeSelect }) => {
  // Different options for different budget tiers
  const getOptionsForTier = (tier) => {
    switch (tier) {
      case 'budget-constrained':
        return staticWebsiteOptions; // Limited to static sites
      case 'full-budget':
        return allWebsiteOptions; // All functionality available
      default:
        return [];
    }
  };

  const options = getOptionsForTier(budgetTier);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Budget-specific guidance */}
      <BudgetGuidance tier={budgetTier} />
      
      {/* Appropriate options for tier */}
      <OptionsGrid 
        options={options}
        selectedType={selectedType}
        onTypeSelect={onTypeSelect}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### **Form Integration Pattern**
```jsx
// Enhanced FormQuestion with conditional logic support
const FormQuestion = ({ question, value, onChange, error, formData }) => {
  switch (question.type) {
    case 'budget_tier_selector':
      return (
        <BudgetTierSelector
          selectedTier={value}
          onTierSelect={onChange}
        />
      );

    case 'conditional_website_type':
      const budgetTier = formData?.budget_tier;
      return (
        <ConditionalTechnicalRequirements
          budgetTier={budgetTier}
          selectedWebsiteType={value}
          onWebsiteTypeSelect={onChange}
        />
      );

    default:
      return <StandardFormField />;
  }
};
```

### **Business Communication Patterns**

#### **Professional Constraint Messaging**
```
"Frame budget constraints professionally by:
- Emphasizing value and quality within constraints
- Explaining business rationale for limitations (sustainability, quality focus)
- Providing clear examples of what IS included
- Using consultative language that builds trust
- Offering context about why constraints enable better service

Example: 'This option focuses on delivering maximum value within budget constraints by streamlining our process while maintaining professional quality standards.'"
```

#### **Expectation Setting Language**
```
"Use expectation-setting language that:
- Clearly communicates what to expect without being negative
- Builds confidence in the chosen approach
- Provides context for decision-making
- Emphasizes collaborative partnership
- Sets realistic timelines and deliverables

Example: 'This approach requires thorough initial scoping as changes are minimal, ensuring we deliver exactly what you need the first time.'"
```

#### **Trust-Building Communication**
```
"Build trust through transparent communication by:
- Being honest about limitations and constraints
- Explaining the reasoning behind different approaches
- Providing clear value propositions for each option
- Using professional, consultative language
- Demonstrating expertise through thoughtful guidance

```
"Provide context-aware guidance that:
- Adapts help text and examples based on selections
- Offers relevant suggestions for each user path
- Explains why certain information is needed
- Provides appropriate examples for the selected context
- Maintains consistent tone and helpfulness throughout

Guidance should feel personalized and relevant."
```

### **Testing and Validation Patterns**

#### **Budget Tier Flow Testing**
```
"Test budget-aware flows by:
- Validating each budget tier path independently
- Ensuring appropriate options appear for each tier
- Testing conditional logic and form state management
- Verifying professional presentation of limitations
- Checking mobile responsiveness for all components

Test both happy paths and edge cases for each tier."
```

#### **Client Experience Validation**
```
"Validate client experience by:
- Testing complete form flows for different budget tiers

- Checking accessibility and usability across devices
- Gathering feedback on expectation clarity and trust-building

Focus on client understanding and confidence building."
```

### **Common Budget-Aware Anti-Patterns**

#### **‚ùå Avoid: Negative Limitation Framing**
```jsx
// DON'T: Frame limitations negatively
<Alert variant="destructive">
  <p>Budget projects can't have these features...</p>
</Alert>
```

#### **‚úÖ Prefer: Professional Value Framing**
```jsx
// DO: Frame as focused value delivery
<Alert variant="info">
  <p>This option focuses on delivering maximum value through streamlined, 
     professional static websites perfect for your needs.</p>
</Alert>
```

#### **‚ùå Avoid: Overwhelming Initial Choices**
```jsx
// DON'T: Show all options without context
<div>
  {allWebsiteTypes.map(type => <Option key={type.id} type={type} />)}
</div>
```

#### **‚úÖ Prefer: Progressive, Context-Aware Disclosure**
```jsx
// DO: Show appropriate options based on budget tier
<div>
  {getOptionsForBudgetTier(budgetTier).map(type => 
    <Option key={type.id} type={type} />
  )}
</div>
```

### **Success Metrics for Budget-Aware Features**

#### **Completion Rate Optimization**
- Budget tier selection completion: Target 95%+
- Conditional flow completion: Target 90%+ after tier selection
- Overall form completion: Monitor impact on total rates
- Client satisfaction with expectation setting

#### **Business Process Improvement**
