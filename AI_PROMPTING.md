## Common Modification Patterns

### Adding New Questions

1. **Location**: `src/types/scoping.js`
2. **Pattern**: Add to the appropriate category's questions array
3. **Required fields**: `id`, `text`, `type`, `required`, `category`
4. **Optional fields**: `hint`, `placeholder`, `options`, `showIf`

Example:
```javascript
{
  id: 'new_question_id',
  text: 'What is your question?',
  type: 'text', // text, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, number
  required: true,
  category: SCOPING_CATEGORIES.BUSINESS,
  hint: 'This helps us understand...',
  placeholder: 'Enter your answer here...'
}
```

### Modifying Form Logic

1. **Conditional Logic**: Update `shouldShowQuestion` function in `src/types/scoping.js`
2. **Validation**: Update `validateAnswer` function in `src/types/scoping.js`
3. **Form Flow**: Modify `FormWizard.jsx` component

### Styling Changes

1. **Use Tailwind CSS classes** - avoid inline styles
2. **Follow existing color scheme** defined in `tailwind.config.js`
3. **Maintain responsive design** with mobile-first approach
4. **Use shadcn/ui components** for consistency

### Adding New Export Formats

1. **Location**: `src/utils/dataExport.js`
2. **Pattern**: Create new export function following existing patterns
3. **Integration**: Add to export options in admin dashboard

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Analyze the request** - understand what needs to be changed
2. **Identify affected files** - determine which components need updates
3. **Plan the implementation** - outline the approach
4. **Make changes** - implement with proper error handling
5. **Test locally** - ensure changes work correctly
6. **Update documentation** - if needed
7. **Commit with descriptive messages**

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Form functionality works correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- [ ] All validation rules work
- [ ] Export functionality works

Use conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(form): add new industry selection question
fix(mobile): resolve touch target sizing issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): improve button hover states
refactor(export): optimize data transformation logic
```
